# worldcoords
This is a GUI-interface for calculating Minecraft world coords from measurments from Google Earth.

You can use the main.py file to run the Python code in your preferred IDE. This will open a GUI window.

This project is in a prototype face, with a ugly but simple GUI. The project is being updated periodically.
