# worldcoords
This is a GUI-interface for calculating Minecraft world coords with measurments from Google Earth.

You can use the main.py file to run the Python code in your preferred IDE. This will open a GUI window.

Use as follows:
1. Decide a refrence point, or your x1 and z1 coordinates, and enter them in the GUI. This is the point from which the other coordinates are measured, based on the measurments you provide.
2. Find a location on Google Earth that you want to use as your refrence point.
3. Use the 'ruler' in Google Earth to measure the distance from this refrence point to the point you want the coordinates of.
4. Copy the 'length' (in metres) and the 'heading' and enter them in the GUI.
5. Decide your scale. For example: if you want to have a 1:1 scale, use 1.0. I personally use a bigger scale: around 1.1, as this makes it easier to build, but still looks like the sizes are right.
6. Click on 'calculate' and now you will so your x2 and z2 coordinates. 


This project is in a prototype face, with a simple but ugly-looking GUI. The project is being updated periodically.
